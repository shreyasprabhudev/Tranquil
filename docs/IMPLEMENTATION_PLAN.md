## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API (simpler than Zustand for MVP)
- **Local Storage**: For offline journal entries
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API for breathing exercises
- **Speech-to-Text**: Web Speech API (browser-native, no external dependencies)
- **AI/ML**: Simple sentiment analysis with natural language processing libraries

### Backend (Django)
- **Framework**: Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (for local development, can be swapped to PostgreSQL later)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth + JWT tokens
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for journal entries and user data
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage (no S3 needed for local dev)

### Development Setup
1. **Local Development**
   - Frontend runs on `localhost:3000`
   - Backend runs on `localhost:8000`
   - SQLite database stored locally
   - Environment variables for configuration

2. **Dependencies**
   - Python 3.9+
   - Node.js 18+
   - pipenv for Python dependencies
   - npm/yarn for frontend dependencies

3. **AI/ML Components** (Simplified for MVP)
   - TextBlob for basic sentiment analysis
   - NLTK for keyword extraction
   - Rule-based prompt generation
