# Tranquil: AI-Powered Journaling Companion - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
An intelligent journaling app that helps users maintain a consistent journaling practice through AI-powered prompts, sentiment analysis, and personalized insights, all while ensuring privacy and ease of use.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication & Profiles
- Email/password and OAuth (Google, Apple) sign-in
- User profile with journaling goals and preferences
- Privacy-focused data storage with on-device processing

### 2. Daily Check-in Flow
- Quick mood selection (emoji-based)
- Voice-to-text journaling with transcription
- Text-based journaling with rich text support
- Quick action buttons for immediate needs:
  - Breathe (guided breathing exercises with visual feedback)
  - Listen (ambient sounds and binaural beats)
  - Reflect (AI-guided questions based on journal history)
  - Gratitude (quick gratitude journaling with prompts)
- Optional daily check-in reminders

### 3. AI-Powered Features

#### Dynamic, Empathetic Prompts
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Store entry metadata (emotions, topics, timestamps) for context
  - Create a prompt generation system that considers:
    - Recent entry content and sentiment
    - Time of day and day of week patterns
    - User's journaling history and preferences
  - Example prompts:
    - "How did you find moments of calm today?" (after stress-related entries)
    - "What's been on your mind since we last spoke?" (after a break in journaling)
    - "You mentioned [topic] yesterday. How do you feel about it today?"

- **Technical Components**:
  - Context tracking middleware
  - Prompt template system
  - User preference storage
  - Response analysis for follow-up prompts

#### Private Sentiment & Theme Analysis
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - On-device NLP processing using TensorFlow.js
  - Sentiment analysis with custom emotion detection
  - Topic modeling for theme extraction
  - Secure local storage for all analysis data

- **Technical Components**:
  - TensorFlow.js models for text analysis
  - Local database for storing analysis results
  - Privacy-preserving data processing pipeline
  - Visualization components for trends and patterns

#### Insightful Reflection Summaries
- **Implementation Approach**:
  - Weekly/Monthly analysis of journal entries
  - Pattern recognition for behavior and mood correlations
  - Personalized insights generation
  - Actionable recommendations

- **Example Insights**:
  - "You mentioned feeling most energized on days you had a morning walk"
  - "Your entries show increased creativity in the evenings"
  - "You've been consistently practicing gratitude this week"

- **Technical Components**:
  - Time-series analysis tools
  - Pattern recognition algorithms
  - Report generation system
  - Notification system for insights delivery

### 4. Dashboard & Analytics
- Mood and sentiment trends
- Journaling streak and consistency
- Keyword and theme clouds
- Customizable insights and reflections

### 5. Content Library & Resources
- **Guided Exercises**
  - Meditation and mindfulness exercises
  - Breathing techniques with visual guides
  - Progressive muscle relaxation
  
- **Journaling Support**
  - Customizable prompt library
  - Writing exercises for self-discovery
  - Gratitude and reflection templates

- **Educational Content**
  - Benefits of journaling
  - Emotional intelligence resources
  - Building healthy habits
  - Stress management techniques

### 6. Privacy & Security
- End-to-end encryption for all journal entries
- Optional biometric authentication
- Clear data export/delete options
- No third-party data sharing
- Transparent privacy policy

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API (simpler than Zustand for MVP)
- **Local Storage**: For offline journal entries
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API for breathing exercises
- **Speech-to-Text**: Web Speech API (browser-native, no external dependencies)
- **AI/ML**: Simple sentiment analysis with natural language processing libraries

### Backend (Django)
- **Framework**: Django REST Framework
- **Database**: SQLite (for local development, can be swapped to PostgreSQL later)
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth + JWT tokens
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for journal entries and user data
- **File Storage**: Local file system storage (no S3 needed for local dev)

### Development Setup
1. **Local Development**
   - Frontend runs on `localhost:3000`
   - Backend runs on `localhost:8000`
   - SQLite database stored locally
   - Environment variables for configuration

2. **Dependencies**
   - Python 3.9+
   - Node.js 18+
   - pipenv for Python dependencies
   - npm/yarn for frontend dependencies

3. **AI/ML Components** (Simplified for MVP)
   - TextBlob for basic sentiment analysis
   - NLTK for keyword extraction
   - Rule-based prompt generation
